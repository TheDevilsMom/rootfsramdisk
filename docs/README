### / in RAM, first release (0.0.1)
### Caution! Entering this is probably Gentoo-is-for-ricers territory! ;-)
### Battery backed system (notebook, UPS) strongly recommended!
### This has been executed on a Thinkpad T480s, 40 GB RAM, NVMe SSD, BIOS boot.

## Section 1: Initial setup. Tested on Funtoo Linux 1.4, probably works with Gentoo also right out of the box, but I didn't test that yet.

# Boot Funtoo Undead USB or any other suitable Linux distro.

# Create tmpfs mount point.
mkdir /mnt/tmpfs	

# Mount tmpfs. Adjust size to your needs. 16 GiB is probably the absolute minimum for a usable desktop configuration.
mount -t tmpfs -o size=24576M tmpfs /mnt/tmpfs/		

# Enter tmpfs.
cd /mnt/tmpfs/

# Fill container with zeros.
dd if=/dev/zero of=loop bs=1M		

# Setup loop device.
losetup /dev/loop0 /mnt/tmpfs/loop

# Create /boot and RAID partitions on non volatile storage, e.g. /dev/sda1 (/boot) and /dev/sda2 (/). DON'T ACCIDENTALLY FRY ANY EXISTING OS! Use lsblk to see
# what block device you are dealing with.

# Create MD device, replace /dev/nvme0n1p2 with your actual SSD/HDD RAID1 partition.
mdadm --create /dev/md0 /dev/loop0 /dev/nvme0n1p2 --level=1 --raid-devices=2

# Disable SSD/HDD
mdadm -f /dev/md0 /dev/nvme0n1p2 && mdadm --manage -r /dev/md0 /dev/nvme0n1p2

# Follow on with chapter 5 Funtoo install guide: https://www.funtoo.org/Install/Creating_Filesystems.

# /etc/fstab for my particular minimalistic test system. Get the UUIDs from blkid output, or use /dev/xxx or labels, whatever...
UUID=91c884e5-bd41-4c0e-b1bf-b68fe6317abd	/boot	ext2	noauto,noatime	1 2
UUID=3e84cb4c-8b13-4cbc-ac3d-7bd9ca56a00d	/	xfs	noatime		0 1

# Add domdadm to the kernel parameters in /etc/boot.conf

# Create /mnt/tmpfs
mkdir /mnt/tmpfs

# After exiting the chroot, rebuild the array.
mdadm --manage -a /dev/md0 /dev/nvme0n1p2

# Wait until this shows "state: clean".
mdadm -D /dev/md0

# Stop loop device.
losetup -D /dev/loop0

# Unmount everything and reboot.


## Section 2: Using rfsrd to start/stop/monitor (needs root, of course).

# Move / from non volatile storage to RAM disk. Do that after booting (that's obvious?!).
rfsrd --start

# Move / from RAM disk to non volatile storage. Do that before shutting down (that's obvious too?!).
rfsrd --stop

# Show which device is active.
rfsrd --active
